					<h2>Got Questions?</h2>
					<label class="question" for="_1"><span><i class="material-icons">add</i></span><span><p>Why should I have a website?</p></span> </label>
					<input id="_1" type="checkbox">
					<div class="answer">
						<p>Here are just some of the reasons:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Rent in New York City is expensive. Rent on the Internet is a fraction of the cost.</li>
							<li>A website gives you credibility as it projects a professional image.</li>
							<li>A website broadens your reach and gives you a wider market</li>
							<li>It keeps people informed.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

					<label class="question" for="_2"><span><i class="material-icons">add</i></span><span><p>What are you going to build it with</p></span> </label>
					<input id="_2" type="checkbox">
					<div class="answer">
						<p>It really depends on what the scope of your project is and how much control you would like over it. We want to choose the tools that actually fit the nature of what we're making. For example, we would use the Jekyll framework for a blog, or Shopify for an online shop.</p>
					</div>

					<label class="question" for="_3"><span><i class="material-icons">add</i></span><span><p>What are you going to charge me?</p></span> </label>
					<input id="_3" type="checkbox">
					<div class="answer">"
						<p>Sorry, we can't give you a number right now as we don't know the nature of your project. If you'd like a rough estimate, we do have a <strong>Project Survey</strong> to better understand what you want. We will only give you an exact number after the first part of the process. Normally design agencies will charge you for the diagnosis, in case you choose not to go along with the project afterwards. But that's not us; we think good will goes a long way, so we're going to do the research whether or not you choose to continue after you see the number.</p>
					</div>

					<label class="question" for="_4"><span><i class="material-icons">add</i></span><span><p>What exactly does "complimentary training" mean?</p></span> </label>
					<input id="_4" type="checkbox">
					<div class="answer">
						<p>We see a lot of people unable to do anything with their website after it's built because they simply have no idea how any of it's done. So complimentary training means we're going to make sure you aren't powerless at no additional cost.</p>
					</div>

					<label class="question" for="_5"><span><i class="material-icons">add</i></span><span><p>Are there any additional costs?</p></span> </label>
					<input id="_5" type="checkbox">
					<div class="answer">
						<p>The Internet is not free. You do have to pay a hosting service and domain name service to keep your website up and running. We'd be happy to recommend some; in fact, we will be during our Research phase. Otherwise, there are no extra costs after the number we give you.</p>
					</div>
					<label class="question" for="_6"><span><i class="material-icons">add</i></span><span><p>I've had a previous experience with developers and it sucked. Now I have an unsatisfactory website so what can you do about it?</p></span> </label>
					<input id="_6" type="checkbox">
					<div class="answer">
						<p>On the bright side, you know what you're unhappy with. Let us know and we'll make sure those things don't happen.</p>
					</div>

					<label class="question" for="_7"><span><i class="material-icons">add</i></span><span><p>How do I know your aesthetic matches mine?</p></span> </label>
					<input id="_7" type="checkbox">
					<div class="answer">
						<p>Maybe it doesn't, but it's not about us. It's about you and your business. </p>
					</div>

					<label class="question" for="_8"><span><i class="material-icons">add</i></span><span><p>How do I know you'll do the right work? You're not experts in my business.</p></span> </label>
					<input id="_8" type="checkbox">
					<div class="answer">
						<p>We're not experts in your field and we won't claim to be! But we are experienced in translating your expertise to a digital world. Let us help you tell your story.</p>
					</div>
					
					<label class="question" for="_8"><span><i class="material-icons">add</i></span><span><p>Neither of you study web design and development, how am I supposed to trust you with this work?</p></span> </label>
					<input id="_8" type="checkbox">
					<div class="answer">
						<p>While our passion lies in our majors, we do like to be well versed in many other technological fields. Web design and development actually do intersect with what we're learning, and in fact, we bring more to the table because of our extended knowledge</p>
