					<h2>Every website is different,<br> and so are the tools</h2>
					<p>Some websites are updated a few times a year and others are updated as often as every day. Typically we prefer to code a website from scratch with HTML5, CSS3, and a Javascript framework, but depending on your needs we also offer popular content management systems such as WordPress and Squarespace. Coding from scratch offers more versatality in design, whereas using a CMS allows for easier content publishing later down the road.</p>

					<h3>Complimentary Training</h3>
					<p>As with any other self respecting programmer we love to keep solid documentation so that you or other future editors can look through your website and easily make changes. We keep records on every technical detail and if you'd like, we'll train you so that you have full control over your website. No added charge!
						<br>You are your cheapeast employee, and we respect that.

				<div class="research mdl-cell mdl-cell--4-col mdl-cell--3-col-desktop">
					<h3>Research</h3>
					<p>The first step is visiting you to talk about your business and what you want on the website. We'll be looking into what defines your brand identity and personality. Then we'll analyze these factors and compile a few plans of attack for you to consider. And we'll do it all over again if you don't like any of them.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="design mdl-cell mdl-cell--4-col mdl-cell--3-col-desktop">
					<h3>Design</h3>
					<p>One of the most important aspects of the website is how it looks. When a customer visits the site, we want them to know instantly that it belongs to you. And the best people to review our designs are you and your customers. We'll come back with various layouts and mockups and you guys can tell us which ones you like. We'll revise it until you're satisfied.</p>

				<div class="developement mdl-cell mdl-cell--4-col mdl-cell--3-col-desktop">
					<h3>Developement</h3>
					<p>In order to ensure that our websites load quickly, and look great on all devices we build them from the ground up. We make sure that everything is properly phrased and coded so that our clients show up as one of the top results on Google. And to top it all off we provide in depth documentation for future reference.</p>
