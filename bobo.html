		<h2>Our Process</h2>
		<div class="main-steps row">
			<div class="step-one col-4">
				<h3>Prepare</h3>
				<p>
					After we've met and discussed what your needs are, we'll spend the next few days obsessively blueprinting and researching. We'll come back with a couple of plans of attack and then discuss how to go forward.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="step-two col-4">
				<h3>Design</h3>
				<p>
					Having decided on a direction to go towards, we'll be designing mockups for your review. Until we obtain your final approval on the design, we are happy to revise it over and over again based on your input.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="step-three col-4">
				<h3>Build</h3>
				<p>
					After we settle on the final design, we can begin the actual coding. After it's built, we'll be testing it and tweaking it until we have every pixel perfected. We'll make sure your site isn't buried deep into search engine results either!
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="step-four row col-12">
			<h3>Launch week!</h3>
			<p>
				Now that it's all done, we'll launch your site with your approval. But it doesn't stop there -- we don't want to just leave you all alone with just a website. We offer complementary training and explanations on what we did so if you need to make alterations after our partnership comes to an end, you're well enabled..

		<h2>$$$PRICING$$$</h2>
		<p>We understand your time is valuable and paying freelancers is also a risk and we respect that. So the way we've chosen to structure our pricing is so that you can jump ship at any point you decide that this venture isn't worth your time or money.</p>
		<p>We can't actually offer you a price on how much it will cost to build your site because no project is the same. We CAN tell you that the average website will probably cost you around a new Toyota.</p>
		<p>But working will us will cost you somewhere from $400 to $1500 depending on what and how much you want.</p>
